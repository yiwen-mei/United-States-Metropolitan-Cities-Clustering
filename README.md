# United-States-Metropolitan-Cities-Clustering

## Introduction

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of metropolitan data, focusing on various socio-economic factors to extract meaningful insights.

## Objectives

- Perform K-means and hierarchical clustering on U.S. metropolitan data.
- Visualize data patterns and interpret the clustering results.

## Data Source

The dataset originates from a list of 325 U.S. metropolitan cities from `cities1.csv`, including Cost_Living, Recreation, Population_2000, Total_Violent, Total_Property, Crime_Trend, Unemployment_Threat and other features.


## Tools and Technologies Used

- R Studio, R Markdown
- R Libraries: ggmap, ggplot2, dplyr, and additional libraries for clustering and data manipulation.

## Results

The best number of clusters is 4, and findings showcases clustered data along with visual representations to highlight similarities and differences among metropolitan areas based on the chosen parameters.
